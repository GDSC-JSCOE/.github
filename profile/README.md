## Google Developer Student Club JSCOE - Code of Conduct


### What does the Google Developer Student Clubs Code of Conduct aim to achieve?

The objective of GDSC is to enable every individual and organisation on the earth to accomplish more. Google Developer Student CLub (Student Lead) representing the community at your college (JSPM JSCOE) is a global network of on-campus leaders ready to support fellow students, lead in their local tech community, and develop future technical and career skills. As a programme, our standards and values represent our dedication to create a positive influence around the world by providing everyone with a respectful, friendly, professional, and inclusive experience. Simply said, we place great importance on an individual's character and leadership. This Code of Conduct is made widely visible by GDSC in order to establish our values, expectations, give reporting mechanisms for conduct infractions, and outline how GDSC may choose to enforce this Code of Conduct.

### What moral standards do we hold our community and those who participate to?

Our program finds strength in diversity and inclusion. In all our interactions, we aspire to embody and champion these values as a program and as a community.

#### •Be respectful and inclusive

- Respect differences of opinion, just because someone holds a different viewpoint from your own, doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.
- Make a conscious effort to include people who differ from you.
- Remember that people have varying communication styles different from your own. Show a willingness to understand more about the experiences of others.
- Ask questions to understand.

#### •Lead with empathy

- Listen with purpose, seek to understand before being understood.
- Conduct yourself professionally and be kind to others.
- Show understanding for another person’s situation and emotions.

#### •Be friendly, open, and welcoming

- Assume good intent and interpret others’ statements or questions in good faith.
- Foster environments that allow all members to feel connected to each other and the community.
- Promote a friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.

#### •Be thoughtful

- Think about how others will interpret your words, productive, clear communication requires effort.
- Be aware of your strengths and weaknesses and how your own behavior and reactions influence others’ emotions and actions.
- Sometimes it is best to pause from commenting or reacting immediately to feedback/constructive criticism.
- We will make mistakes. When others are not at their best, we should reach out, offer support, and seek to understand. When you are at fault, listen, and ask how you can make things right.
